In this folder you can find scripts associated with the project's analysis.

### integration_function.R:
R function sourced in distal_integration_PCHiC.R and proximal_integration_PCHiC.R to integrate PCHiC data with other omics, in order to identify p53 targets.

### distal_integration_PCHiC.R:
Analysis script to identify distal p53 targets: genes distally interacting with a functional p53-bound enhancer.

### proximal_integration_PCHiC.R:
Analysis script to identify proximal p53 targets: genes associated to p53-bound promoter.
